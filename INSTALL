NWN Server Administration Installation Instructions

Installation of NWN Server Administration is pretty 
easy and straight forward as long as you have the 
prerequisites installed correctly.  In order to run 
NWN Server Administration you need to have the following:

Linux Server (any version of Linux should work, but tested on Redhat Linux 8)
Apache (1.3 or 2.0 should work just fine)
PHP
HTPASSWD File for Access Control.
Expect installed in /usr/bin (else you will have to manually edit all the expect scripts)
Screen in path (Installed automatically with most Linux installations)
NeverWinter Nights Server Software (Requires files from the original NeverWinter Nights CD)

After you have installed the following, and Apache with PHP 
support is running correctly, then installing NWN Server 
Administration is quite simple, but before we get there, 
here are some things to check and make sure of in your 
PHP and Apache configurations:

In your php.ini:

Make sure register_globals is on.
post_max_size should be increased, mine is set to 100M.  This is what determines the maximum size of files when uploading/posting.
file_uploads should be on.
upload_max_size is related to above and should be set the same as post_max_size.
safe_mode should be off.
If you have a LimitRequestBody <value> line, change the value to represent what size you want to limit uploads to.  <value> is in bytes.

In your httpd.conf:

Apache should be running under a non-privileged user such as nobody.
For the directory where you will put NWN Server Administration, you should have the following set: 
	<Directory "/your/directory">
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
	AllowOverride AuthConfig
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	</Directory>
Set DirectoryIndex to index.html and index.php

Your NWN Server Installation:

Make sure all files user and group is set to the same user and group that Apache is running under.

I make it a habit when I install Apache to use Virtual Hosts, that way if I 
ever want to put up another page on that server, it's pretty easily done.  

After the above is done, and everything is running correctly, unzip/untar the 
NWNPHPAdmin-x.x.x.tar.zip to where you want it installed:

cd /directory
tar zxvf /path/to/NWNPHPAdmin-x.x.x.tar.zip
Change ownership and access of files to same user Apache is running under:
chown -R user:user /directory
chmod -R 775 /directory

Setup your VirtualHost in Apache:

<VirtualHost *>
ServerName nwnadmin.url.com1
ServerAdmin yourname@yourdomain.com
DocumentRoot /directory/to/nwnserveradmin
CustomLog /usr/local/apache/logs/nwncontrol_access_log combined
</VirtualHost>

Restart Apache:  /etc/init.d/httpd restart

Point your browser towards the server, and the page should come up.  Initially 
when it first comes up, if any path's are incorrect it will show the path page 
and show an **Incorrect Path** for anything that's not correct, you should change 
these path's to point towards the correct file, then click Save.

Also on User Privileges, an initial install will not have access control enabled, 
you will be able to do anything, if you wish to setup access control, be sure to 
first set your path for htpasswd, when you set the path to htpasswd, and supply 
a user auth file the .htaccess file will be created for you, and will look like
this:

AuthName "Restricted Stuff"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/to/userfile
Require valid-user

When you set the path for .htpasswd, and for the userauth file, it will come up
and ask you for the initial username and password, and will create that user,
and add it to the administrators list.

NOTE: If you are upgrading between versions, sometimes new features require new 
programs where I need to have the path's for those programs, when I update the 
path's list, it's always good to remove your path's file and let it recreate it.  
You will have to reset all your path's again.  The file is located in the main 
directory of NWN Server Administration is is called "pathfile". 

If you have any problems or difficulties, please DO NOT email me directly, 
please post your question/problem in our Message Boards (http://projects.putercom.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=5)

ENJOY!
