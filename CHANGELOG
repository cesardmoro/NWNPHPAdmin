CHANGELOG

==========
0.9.8
==========
o = Fixed problem with Character Administration with usernames with symbols in their names such as '-'.  Also fixed
    the Administration priviledges with same problem.
o = Fixed issue with a Non-Privilidged user couldn't download the NWN Campaigns.
o = Fixed issue with deleting a character with a symbol in the name.
+ = Added HotU protraits and classes.
x = Changed access priviledges on Character Administration.  Made Deleting characters a seperate priviledge.
x = Changed access on Uploading files, Upload is now a seperate priviledge.
+ = Added a NWN Server Administration Options page, currently has adminemail address setting, and ability to hide/show
    unpriviledged commands to the user.

==========
0.9.7
==========
o = Fixed problem with an initial install, if you didn't setup User Authentication or tried to set it up the program
    would get an error.
o = If Server crashes, or some other weird mishappening, then the next time you load a module, it will have problems
    bringing up the status, this is because of a corrupted Logs.x file.  Upon killing the server, I put in code to
    delete these files, as they are not needed, this will ensure a clean start.
+ = Added an automated system to help setup User Authentication and the associated files.
x = Rewrote the README file.
+ = Wrote INSTALL instructions.

==========
0.9.6
==========
o = Fixed Login names with spaces. They were not working to be able to edit characters or change passwords, fixed this so 
    users with spaces in their names now work correctly.
o = When uploading characters, the default permissions were not correct, this is now fixed.
o = If you changed the path's to your NWN Server directory, the symbolic links would not change, I added code into the
    path save area, to delete the symbolic links if they exist (if you change any path settings), they will get recreated
    from the check path code, with the correct links.
o = Fixed problem when giving users priviledges, if you put a , and a space after, it would error saying that the user does
    not exists.  Added code to remove all spaces between commas, but still allows for usernames with spaces in them.
+ = Added full Backup Administration over NWN Files.  This feature will build a script based upon what you want to backup
    and will automatically schedule it in CRON for you.
+ = Added ability to view general character stats in Character Administration.
+ = Added new SoU Character Classes and Races.
+ = Added NWM (Neverwinter Nights Campaign) Support.  *NOTE*: This was originally installed and implemented by the original 
    author, but when I first started reprogramming it, I pulled it out, not knowing exactly why it was there.  I can see a 
    need for this now, so I added it back in.
o = Server version 1.30 and > now work to Kick/Ban by CD-Key.
o = Fixed problem with uploading files with characters other than alphanumeric.

==========
0.9.5
==========
o = Certain circumstances the server will stop logging to the logs.0 directory and start a new one with the next number
    i.e logs.1, logs.2, etc.  This in turn would cause the status screen not to display properly.  I put in a check on
    the Info and Status screens, if anything other than logs.0 exists, then it tells you to save your game, and stop
    and restart the server, it deletes all logs.x directories.  When you stop/restart the server, it will recreate the
    logs.0 directory.  Found out that this happens if you already have a server running and you attempt to start another
    one.  I must have found this out during testing as I was starting a server manually via commandline. 
o = Fixed BanInfo screen from doing a refresh automatically.  
+ = When you change a game setting, there are some settings that can be changed while the server is running, these are:
    Maxplayers, Minlevel, MaxLevel, PauseandPlay, ELC, ILR, Oneparty, Difficulty, AutoSaveInterval, PlayerPassword,
    DMPassword, AdminPassword, and Servername.  Previous, when you changed these in game settings, it only changed them in
    the config file, and you would have to stop/start the server for them to take affect.  Now, when you change these, it
    will change them on the running server as well.  I created an expect script to do this.
o = Ban/Unban/Kick wasn't working properly under Server version 1.30, I modified the script to accomodate for the changes.  
    Though unable to Ban or Kick a user by CD Key, I believe this to be a bug in server version 1.30.  Also added the client 
    info to the kick/ban screen, instead of having to click on clientinfo off that screen.
+ = Added a way to manually ban an IP, User, or CD Key.

==========
0.9.0
==========
x = Wayne Catterton now improving upon program.
o = Fixed Upload Module to display, and to upload to appropriate directory.  Also made it check to make sure it was a .mod file.
+ = Added ability to Delete Save Game Slots.
+ = Added Admin users variable anyone that is not listed in here, will not see admin type commands on Apache servers with PHP 
    installed as a mod.  If you don't use any authentication methods, then set admin variable to equal NONE.
+ = Added Administration settings for setting the Admin Users variable, and to change what functions each user can control.
x = Change status and info screens to include module name that is running, and if no module is running it displays that
    Server is not running.
+ = Added User Administration for managing your users that connect to the site. Ability to Add/Delete Users and change passwords.
+ = Added Path settings area that allows you to specify the various path's and such of where things reside.
+ = Added ability for logged on user to change password.
+ = Added ability to Upload HAK files to Server, Download HAK files from server.  Lists what HAK files are on the server.
+ = Added ability to Upload Music files to Server, Download Music files from server.  Lists what Music files are on the server.
+ = Added ability to Upload Movie files to Server, Download Movie files from server.  Lists what Movie files are on the server.
+ = Added ability to Upload a .zip file, it will unzip the file and copy the
    files to the appropriate directories, unless the file already exists, then it will let you know.
x = Adjusted Expect scripts to wait for prompts when loading modules/saved games, also added a slight delay between when it loads 
    the module and refreshes the screen, this fixes a problem where you'd get garbage on the screen.
x = Cleaned up code (tabbed it out, or structured it)
+ = If a configuration file does not exist on the server, then it will create one with default settings.
+ = Added Character Administration (Ability to Uplaod/Download characters in your vault, as well as delete any you don't wish to
    have anymore.)
+ = Added a full system to Backup data on server, it will schedule it and place it in a CRON job.
x = When displaying server status, made the module name a link you can click to get the info about the current running module.
x = Added Descriptions to Game Settings.
o = Fixed Player, DM and Admin password, if you leave box blank, then it set's them to = "", this in turn will disable them when the 	server is run.
x = When saving a Game, if you have administrator priveledges, it will allow you to overwrite a slot, if you don't, then you have to	choose an empty slot.
o = Fixed/Optimized expect scripts.  Set Timeouts to 5 minutes (Some large modules may take a long time to laod), added commands to 	clear and detatch from the screen sessions to make things a little quicker.  Added expects for common errors that may come up, 
    so that it will not wait forever.
o = Tracked down slowness when running expect/screen under the nobody account, found out it was getting permission denied for every
    option listed in the /etc/screenrc file.  Tried to figure it out, but was unable to come up with a solution.  So I set Apache to
    run under a valid user account.  
x = Fixed Info and Status screens, if server information is garbled or doesn't come up, it will wait 10 seconds then refresh.
    Loading of large modules sometimes makes it take a while before it's able to get a status of the server.
